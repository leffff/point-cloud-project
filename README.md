# point-cloud-project
My first Point Cloud Project on [this Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/point-cloud-segmentation) which is originally a part of [Semantic3D](http://semantic3d.net/) Dataset

My pet project features several models, that i have benchmarked: KNN, CatBoots, BERT and GCNN

Scores: 
| Model       | Accuracy    | Balanced accuracy | F1 weighted |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| KNN      | some score  | some score        | some score  |
| CatBoost   | some score  | some score        | some score  |
| BERT      | some score  | some score        | some score  |
| GNN   | some score  | some score        | some score  |
